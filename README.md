Programming Languages Structure I
=================================

*[C S 471](http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/wp13/undergrad-courses/) is an Undergraduate course taught at NMSU that I took my Senior Year of
studies during the fall 2013 semester.*

The assignments contained in this repository are simple tasks meant to build
our familiarity with a variety of different programming languages and
programming paradigms.
This class provided quick snapshot views of the different types of programming
languages we are likely to encounter and served to whet my appetite for
different solutions in my programs. For instance, I cannot wait to use a **free**
implementation of Prolog to do some things with Artificial Intelligence.

Assignment 1: Logic Programming
-------------------------------

Contained in Assignment1 is the 4 problems we were given to solve using the
SICStus implementation of Prolog version 4.2.3. SICStus was used with a valid
educational license issued to New Mexico State University.
